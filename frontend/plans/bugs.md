## Files to Investigate

This section lists specific files that should be investigated for potential bugs.

### Authentication

*   **`nuxt.config.ts`**: 
    *   **Why**: This file contains the configuration for `@qirolab/nuxt-sanctum-authentication`. A misconfiguration could lead to security vulnerabilities.
*   **`middleware/auth.global.ts`**: 
    *   **Why**: This middleware is responsible for protecting routes. An error in this file could expose protected routes to unauthenticated users.

### Data Visualization

*   **`components/charts/OrdersTrendChart.vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: This component uses `echarts`. Check if the data passed to the chart is a reactive property to ensure that the chart updates when the data changes.

### State Management

*   **`composables/useCart.ts` and `composables/useWishlist.ts`**: 
    *   **Why**: These composables manage the state of the cart and wishlist. Review the code for any potential race conditions or inconsistent state updates.
*   **`components/cart/CartCounter.vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: This component displays the number of items in the cart. Verify that it correctly reflects the state of the cart and updates in real-time.

### Error Handling

*   **`nuxt.config.ts` and `sentry.client.config.ts`**: 
    *   **Why**: These files contain the configuration for Sentry. Ensure that the Sentry DSN is configured correctly and that there are filters in place to prevent sensitive data from being sent to Sentry.



This document lists potential bugs found in the project.

## Authentication

*   **`@qirolab/nuxt-sanctum-authentication`**: 
    *   **Potential Bug**: The package might have known vulnerabilities. It's important to check for any open security advisories for this package.
    *   **How to check**: Check the package's GitHub repository for any open issues or security advisories. Use a tool like `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.

## Data Visualization

*   **`d3`, `d3-org-chart`, `echarts`, `vue-echarts`, `nuxt-echarts`**: 
    *   **Potential Bug**: These libraries can sometimes have issues with reactivity in Vue.js. If the data passed to the charts is not updated correctly, the charts may not re-render as expected.
    *   **How to check**: Review the code that uses these libraries and ensure that the data is passed as a reactive property.

## State Management

*   **`useCart.ts`, `useWishlist.ts`**: 
    *   **Potential Bug**: If the state is not managed correctly, there could be issues with data consistency. For example, the cart counter might not update correctly when an item is added to the cart.
    *   **How to check**: Review the implementation of these composables and ensure that the state is updated in a predictable and consistent manner.

## Error Handling

*   **`sentry/nuxt`**: 
    *   **Potential Bug**: If Sentry is not configured correctly, it might not capture all the errors, or it might capture too much data, which could have privacy implications.
    *   **How to check**: Review the Sentry configuration in `nuxt.config.ts` and ensure that it's configured to capture the correct level of errors and that it's not logging any sensitive data.

## Memory Leaks

*   **General**: 
    *   **Potential Bug**: There could be memory leaks in the application, especially with complex components and event listeners.
    *   **How to check**: Use the browser's developer tools to profile the application's memory usage and identify any potential leaks.
