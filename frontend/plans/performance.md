# Performance Optimization Plan

This document outlines potential performance optimizations for the project.

## Dependency Analysis

*   **`@nuxtjs/google-fonts`**: 
    *   **Why**: While using this module is a good practice, it's important to ensure it's configured optimally. Loading too many fonts or font weights can negatively impact performance.
    *   **Where to optimize**: Check the `nuxt.config.ts` file for the `googleFonts` configuration.
    *   **How to optimize**: 
        *   Only request the font weights that are actually used in the project.
        *   Use the `display=swap` option to ensure text remains visible while fonts are loading.
        *   Preconnect to the Google Fonts domain.

*   **`@vite-pwa/nuxt`**: 
    *   **Why**: Caching assets effectively is crucial for a good PWA experience and for faster subsequent visits.
    *   **Where to optimize**: Check the `nuxt.config.ts` file for the `pwa` configuration.
    *   **How to optimize**: 
        *   Ensure that the service worker is configured to cache static assets (JS, CSS, images) with a `StaleWhileRevalidate` strategy.
        *   Pre-cache the main application shell.

*   **`@vue-pdf-viewer/viewer`**: 
    *   **Why**: This component can be large and should not be included in the initial bundle if it's not needed on every page.
    *   **Where to optimize**: Check the components that use the PDF viewer.
    *   **How to optimize**: 
        *   Use dynamic imports (`import()`) to load the component only when it's needed.
        *   Consider using a placeholder or a loading indicator while the component is being loaded.

*   **`d3`, `d3-org-chart`, `echarts`, `vue-echarts`, `nuxt-echarts`**: 
    *   **Why**: These data visualization libraries are known to be large. Including them in the main bundle can significantly increase the initial load time.
    *   **Where to optimize**: Check the components that use these libraries.
    *   **How to optimize**: 
        *   Ensure that tree-shaking is working correctly by only importing the specific functions or components that are needed.
        *   Load these libraries asynchronously using dynamic imports.
        *   Consider server-side rendering for the charts if they are static.

*   **`gsap`**: 
    *   **Why**: GSAP is a powerful animation library, but it can be overkill for simple animations. CSS animations are often more performant for simple transitions.
    *   **Where to optimize**: Review the usage of GSAP throughout the project.
    *   **How to optimize**: 
        *   Use CSS animations or transitions for simple animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-in).
        *   Use GSAP for complex animations that require a high degree of control and synchronization.
        *   Ensure that GSAP animations are optimized and don't cause layout shifts.

*   **`swiper`**: 
    *   **Why**: Sliders can be resource-intensive, especially on mobile devices.
    *   **Where to optimize**: Check the components that use the swiper library.
    *   **How to optimize**: 
        *   Use lazy loading for images within the slider.
        *   Optimize the images for mobile devices.
        *   Avoid using too many effects or transitions.

*   **`vue-advanced-cropper`**: 
    *   **Why**: Similar to the PDF viewer, this component should be loaded on-demand.
    *   **Where to optimize**: Check the components that use the image cropper.
    *   **How to optimize**: 
        *   Use dynamic imports to load the component only when it's needed.

*   **`@nuxt/icon`**: 
    *   **Why**: This module can include a large number of icons if not configured properly.
    *   **Where to optimize**: Check the `nuxt.config.ts` file for the `icon` configuration.
    *   **How to optimize**: 
        *   Specify which icon sets to use to avoid including all of them.

*   **`tailwindcss`**: 
    *   **Why**: Tailwind CSS can generate a large amount of CSS, but it has a purge feature to remove unused styles.
    *   **Where to optimize**: Check the `tailwind.config.js` file.
    *   **How to optimize**: 
        *   Ensure that the `purge` or `content` option is configured correctly to scan all the necessary files for CSS classes.

## Files to Optimize

This section lists specific files that are good candidates for optimization.

### Components

*   **`components/charts/OrdersTrendChart.vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: This component uses `echarts`, which is a large library.
    *   **How to optimize**: Load the component asynchronously using dynamic imports.

*   **`components/product/ProductMediaSlider.vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: This component uses `swiper` and likely contains images.
    *   **How to optimize**: Use lazy loading for the images within the slider.

*   **`components/account/AvatarUploader.vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: This component uses `vue-advanced-cropper`, which is a specialized component that is not needed on every page.
    *   **How to optimize**: Load the component asynchronously using dynamic imports.

*   **`components/blog/BlogList.vue` and `components/blog/BlogSingle.vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: These components are content-heavy and would benefit from Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for better SEO.
    *   **How to optimize**: If SSR is enabled, ensure that the data for these components is fetched on the server.

### Pages

*   **`pages/dashboard/**/*.vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: These pages are only accessible to authenticated users and are not critical for the initial page load.
    *   **How to optimize**: Use dynamic imports to load these pages on demand.

*   **`pages/product/[url].vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: This is a product details page and would benefit from SSR for better SEO.
    *   **How to optimize**: If SSR is enabled, ensure that the product data is fetched on the server.

*   **`pages/store/checkout.vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: This is a critical page in the user journey and should be as fast as possible.
    *   **How to optimize**: Analyze the component and its dependencies to identify any performance bottlenecks.

### Composables

*   **`composables/useCart.ts` and `composables/useWishlist.ts`**: 
    *   **Why**: These files manage the state of the cart and wishlist. Any inefficiencies in these files can affect the performance of the entire application.
    *   **How to optimize**: Review the code for any unnecessary computations or state updates.

### Assets

*   **`assets/css/main.css`**: 
    *   **Why**: This file contains global CSS. Large CSS files can block rendering.
    *   **How to optimize**: Review the CSS and remove any unused styles. Consider using a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS to reduce the CSS size.

*   **`public/images/`**: 
    *   **Why**: This folder contains images that are served directly to the browser. Large images can significantly slow down page load times.
    *   **How to optimize**: Compress all images and use modern image formats like WebP.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

*   **Why**: Since `ssr` is set to `false` in `nuxt.config.ts`, the application is a Single Page Application (SPA). This can lead to a slower initial page load and can be detrimental to SEO.
*   **How to optimize**: Consider enabling SSR. This will require some refactoring, but it can significantly improve performance and SEO.

## Code Splitting for Routes

*   **Why**: Even with `ssr: false`, Nuxt's file-based routing automatically code-splits pages. However, we can be more granular.
*   **How to optimize**: Identify pages that are not critical for the initial user experience and consider loading them dynamically. For example, the `/dashboard` pages could be loaded on demand.

## Analyze Bundle Size

*   **Why**: The `build.analyze` option is available in `nuxt.config.ts`. This is a great way to visualize the bundle and identify large dependencies.
*   **How to optimize**: Run `npm run build -- --analyze` to generate the bundle analysis report. Use this report to identify large modules that can be optimized or replaced.

## Image Optimization

*   **Why**: Large images can significantly slow down page load times.
*   **Where to optimize**: Check the `assets` and `public` folders for images.
*   **How to optimize**:
    *   Compress all images using a tool like `imagemin` or an online service.
    *   Use modern image formats like WebP.
    *   Use responsive images with the `<picture>` element or the `srcset` attribute.
    *   Use lazy loading for images that are not in the initial viewport.

## Code Splitting

*   **Why**: By default, Nuxt.js does a good job of code-splitting, but it's important to ensure that it's working as expected.
*   **Where to optimize**: Review the page and component structure.
*   **How to optimize**:
    *   Use dynamic imports for components and pages that are not needed on the initial load.
    *   Analyze the bundle size using a tool like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to identify large chunks.
