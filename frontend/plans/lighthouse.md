## Files to Audit

This section lists specific files that should be audited to improve the Lighthouse score.

### Performance

*   **`nuxt.config.ts`**: 
    *   **Why**: This file contains the build and rendering configuration. Ensure that the build is configured for production with minification and code splitting enabled.
*   **`pages/**/*.vue` and `components/**/*.vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: These files are the main components of the application. Analyze them for any performance bottlenecks, such as large components, unnecessary re-renders, or inefficient loops.
*   **`assets/css/main.css`**: 
    *   **Why**: This file contains global CSS. Large CSS files can block rendering. Ensure that the CSS is minified and that unused styles are purged.
*   **`public/images/`**: 
    *   **Why**: This folder contains images that are served directly to the browser. Ensure that all images are compressed and served in modern formats like WebP.

### Accessibility

*   **`app.vue`, `layouts/**/*.vue`, `pages/**/*.vue`, `components/**/*.vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: All `.vue` files that render HTML should be checked for accessibility issues. This includes checking for proper use of semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and focus management.

### Best Practices

*   **`nuxt.config.ts`**: 
    *   **Why**: This file is where you can configure security-related headers and other best practices. Ensure that the application is served over HTTPS and that it's not using any deprecated APIs.

### SEO

*   **`nuxt.config.ts`**: 
    *   **Why**: This file is where you can set global meta tags. Ensure that the application has a global `meta` description.
*   **`pages/**/*.vue`**: 
    *   **Why**: These files are where you can set page-specific meta tags using `useHead`. Ensure that each page has a unique and descriptive `meta` title and description.



This document outlines how to improve the project's Lighthouse score.

## Performance

*   **Reduce initial server response time**: 
    *   **Why**: A slow server response time can significantly impact the perceived performance of the application.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Optimize server-side rendering (SSR) by caching frequently requested pages.
        *   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets.

*   **Eliminate render-blocking resources**: 
    *   **Why**: Render-blocking resources, such as CSS and JavaScript files, can delay the initial rendering of the page.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Inline critical CSS.
        *   Load non-critical CSS and JavaScript files asynchronously using the `async` or `defer` attributes.

*   **Properly size images**: 
    *   **Why**: Serving images that are larger than the size at which they are displayed can waste bandwidth and slow down page load times.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Use responsive images with the `<picture>` element or the `srcset` attribute to serve different image sizes based on the user's screen size.

*   **Defer offscreen images**: 
    *   **Why**: Lazy loading images that are not in the initial viewport can improve the initial load time.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Use the `loading="lazy"` attribute on `<img>` tags.

*   **Minify CSS and JavaScript**: 
    *   **Why**: Minifying CSS and JavaScript files can reduce their size and improve load times.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Ensure that the build process is configured to minify CSS and JavaScript files.

## Accessibility

*   **Ensure that all interactive elements are focusable and have a visible focus indicator**: 
    *   **Why**: This is important for users who navigate the application using a keyboard.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Use the `:focus` pseudo-class to add a visible focus indicator to all interactive elements.

*   **Provide text alternatives for all non-text content**: 
    *   **Why**: This is important for users who are blind or have low vision.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Use the `alt` attribute on `<img>` tags to provide a text alternative for images.
        *   Use ARIA attributes to provide text alternatives for other non-text content, such as icons.

*   **Ensure that the application can be navigated using a keyboard**: 
    *   **Why**: This is important for users who cannot use a mouse.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Ensure that all interactive elements can be reached and activated using the keyboard.

## Best Practices

*   **Use HTTPS**: 
    *   **Why**: HTTPS is important for security and is a requirement for many modern web features, such as service workers.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Ensure that the application is served over HTTPS.

*   **Avoid using deprecated APIs**: 
    *   **Why**: Deprecated APIs may be removed in future browser versions, which could break the application.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Check the browser's developer console for any warnings about deprecated APIs.

## SEO

*   **Provide a `meta` description**: 
    *   **Why**: The `meta` description is used by search engines to generate a snippet for the page in the search results.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Use the `useHead` composable to add a `meta` description to each page.

*   **Use descriptive link text**: 
    *   **Why**: Descriptive link text can help search engines understand the content of the linked page.
    *   **How to improve**: 
        *   Use descriptive text for all links, instead of generic text like "click here".
