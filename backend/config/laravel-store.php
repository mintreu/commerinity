    | Sales Configuration
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Manage settings related to Sales in your store.
    |
    | "status" determines whether the Sales feature is enabled or disabled.
    |
    | "targets" defines the models that a Sale can be applied to. These should
    | be fully qualified model class names. For example, you may want to attach
    | sales to specific User Groups, Customer Groups, Membership Levels, or
    | Communities. The package uses polymorphic relations, so you can extend
    | this list freely based on your applicationâ€™s needs.
    |
    | Example:
    |   'targets' => [
    |       App\Models\User::class,
    |       App\Models\CustomerGroup::class,
    |       App\Models\Community::class,

    | Voucher Configuration
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |

    |
    | "status" determines whether the Vouchers feature is enabled or disabled.
    |
    | "targets" defines the models that a Voucher can be applied to. Just like
    | sales, this is an array of fully qualified model class names. This allows
    | vouchers to be attached to different entities such as Users, Groups, or
    | custom models defined in your application.
    |
    | Example:
    |   'targets' => [
    |       App\Models\User::class,
    |       App\Models\CustomerGroup::class,
    |   ],
